# Question-pairs-detection

Description:
This project aims to detect duplicate question pairs using various natural language
processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The model takes two
input questions and predicts whether they are duplicates or not. This can be particularly
useful in platforms like Quora, where multiple users might ask the same question in
different ways.
